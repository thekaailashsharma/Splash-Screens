## Types of Splash Screens
1. `Minimalistic`: Screens featuring only logos and minimal animations, commonly seen in messaging apps like `WhatsApp` and `Telegram Messenger`.

2. `Engaging`: Screens with superficial animations, popular in `gaming` and `OTT apps`, designed to captivate users during the loading process.

## Project Scope
This repository showcases various splash screens, including those inspired by industry giants like `Disney+ Hotstar`, `Netflix`, and `Apple`.



## Contributions 
I invite contributions and feedback on splash screen experiences, particularly those inspired by platforms like Uber. Let's collaborate to enhance waiting experiences in applications and delight users!
